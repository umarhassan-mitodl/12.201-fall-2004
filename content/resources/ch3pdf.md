  of the internal field: the geodynamo, crustal field and rock magnetism, magnetization,
  other types of magnetization, magnetic cleaning procedures, paleomagnetism, field
  reversals, qualitative arguments that explain the need for core-mantle coupling,
  reversals: time scale, sea floor spreading, magnetic anomalies, magnetic anomaly
  profiles.'
