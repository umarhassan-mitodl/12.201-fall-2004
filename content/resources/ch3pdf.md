  The main field, the internal field, the external field, the magnetic induction due
  to a magnetic dipole, magnetic potential due to more complex configurations, power
  spectrum of the magnetic field, downward continuation, secular variation, source
  of the internal field: the geodynamo, crustal field and rock magnetism, magnetization,
  other types of magnetization, magnetic cleaning procedures, paleomagnetism, field
  reversals, qualitative arguments that explain the need for core-mantle coupling,
  reversals: time scale, sea floor spreading, magnetic anomalies, magnetic anomaly
  profiles.'
